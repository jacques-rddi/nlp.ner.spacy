Its shares have risen from the equivalent of about $7 in 2013, when Baillie Gifford first invested, to more than $438 after trading closed on Thursday. Its market value has quintupled during 2020 to $415bn.</p> <p>The rise has astonished many of Tesla’s army of admirers, as well as critics who argue it is a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/jul/18/tesla-valuation-elon-musk-profit\">massive investment bubble</a>. However, SMIT, an investment fund listed on the FTSE 100, argued that Tesla, which has been profitable for five consecutive quarters, could be one of the firms that most benefits from the transition away from fossil fuels.</p> <p>In its half-year report, published on Friday, its managers said: “Whilst the company and its colourful founder attract an unusually high degree of attention, emotion and noise, the underlying return picture is far from an aberration. Returns are concentrated in a handful of big winners.</p> <p>“Tesla has made significant operational progress. It has successfully added capacity and the production ramp of its latest model has progressed far more smoothly than for any of its previous vehicles. Demand for its products is strong and the response from its traditional competitors remains muted.”</p> <p>Tesla shares accounted for 12% of the value of SMIT’s investment portfolio. The carmaker was responsible for a quarter of SMIT’s entire performance during the six months to the end of September.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/3887\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for\\xa0Business\\xa0Today\" data-form-description=\"Get the headlines and editors\\' picks every weekday morning.\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden\\xa0email-sub__iframe ja-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Baillie Gifford manages assets worth £296bn.
